## fakeapp

Pissed of spyware or apps installed without your consent by "some entity"? Yes? Then, this is for you.

## How to use

Turn off internet completely (mobile data and wifi), search for the app you need to remove, uninstall the one you want to replace and install the fake one, then auth it with Dhizuku to avoid it being removed by OTAs (launch the settings activity of the app using apps like root activity launcher or app manager and then select use dhizuku). If the app you need isn't here you can change the package name with apktool M app and rebuild an existing one.
